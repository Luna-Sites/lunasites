# Custom Section Block - Image D&D Implementation

## Completed Tasks 

### Phase 1: Content Resize Support for Image Blocks
-  **Updated contentResizeConfig.js** - Registered `image` as content-resizable block type
-  **Defined resize properties** for image blocks:
  - `imageWidth`: Horizontal resize (100-800px, blue handles)
  - `imagePadding`: Vertical padding (0-60px, green handles)

### Phase 2: Image Component Updates  
-  **Updated Image View component** (`src/components/Blocks/Image/View.jsx`)
  - Added BlockResizeHandles integration
  - Added conditional rendering for edit mode and selected state
  - Applied resize properties to styling
-  **Updated Image Edit component** (`src/components/Blocks/Image/Edit.jsx`)
  - Added resize functionality to edit mode (crucial for Custom Section Block)
  - Applied width and padding properties from data
  - Added resize handles with proper colors

### Phase 3: D&D System Improvements
-  **Enhanced DraggableGridBlock collision detection**
  - Improved grid container detection with fallbacks
  - Added error handling and logging
  - Better snap position calculations
-  **Improved grid snapping accuracy**
  - Reduced threshold constants for more responsive snapping
  - Changed from floor to round for more natural behavior
  - Added boundary checking and fallback positioning
-  **Enhanced GridLayout positioning algorithm**
  - More efficient collision resolution (horizontal first, then vertical, then diagonal)
  - Reduced search radius for better performance

## Current Status

**Image blocks now have full drag & drop support in Custom Section Block grid mode:**

1. **Drag & Drop**: Image blocks can be dragged and repositioned in the 12-column grid
2. **Content Resize**: Selected image blocks show blue (width) and green (padding) resize handles
3. **Collision Detection**: Improved algorithm prevents blocks from overlapping
4. **Grid Snapping**: Enhanced snapping provides smoother user experience

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `contentResizeConfig.js` - Added image block configuration
- `components/Blocks/Image/View.jsx` - Added resize handles to view component  
- `components/Blocks/Image/Edit.jsx` - **Key fix**: Added resize handles to edit component
- `DraggableGridBlock.jsx` - Enhanced drag calculations and error handling
- `GridLayout.jsx` - Improved collision resolution algorithm

### Key Fix:
The main issue was that Custom Section Block renders child blocks using their **edit** components, but resize functionality was only added to the **view** component. Adding resize support to the Image Edit component resolved the issue.

### Resize Properties:
- `imageWidth`: Controls figure width (100-800px)
- `imagePadding`: Controls container padding (0-60px)

## Next Steps (Future Work)

1. **Add more block types**: Text, video, teaser blocks
2. **Additional resize properties**: Height, margin, font size
3. **Better visual feedback**: Drag preview, snap indicators
4. **Performance optimization**: Throttle resize updates, optimize re-renders
5. **User documentation**: Add help tooltips, user guide

## Recent Fix: Image Width Resize Issue

### ✅ Problem Resolved: Width Resize Not Working

**Issue**: Image block width resize handles were visible but not actually resizing the image width.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Responsive Image Override**: The `Image` component with `responsive={true}` was overriding custom width styles
2. **CSS Specificity**: Image component's built-in styles had higher specificity than custom width
3. **Incorrect Target Element**: Width was being applied to `<Image>` component instead of container

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Moved width styling from Image to figure container**:
   - Applied `imageWidth` to the `<figure>` element instead of `<Image>` component
   - This constrains the overall container width
   
2. **Made Image fill container**:
   - Changed Image width to `100%` to fill the figure container
   - Maintains responsive behavior within the constrained width

**Files Modified**:
- `components/Blocks/Image/Edit.jsx` - Fixed width application target

**Result**: Width resize now works correctly for image blocks, matching button block behavior.

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Create a Custom Section Block
2. Switch to Grid mode
3. Add image blocks
4. Verify drag & drop works smoothly
5. Select an image block and test width/padding resize handles ✅ **Width resize now working**
6. Try different grid positions and verify collision detection
