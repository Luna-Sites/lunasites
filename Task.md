i want to do soemthing crazy.

do you know how the sections work in squarespace? inside the section block you have a grid like, so when you drag an element you can place it whereever in that space and it remains like that. I want that feature inside the custom section we made previously. right now the blocks take all the width of the page, so we also have to do something about that
